# CodeX Marketing Analytics – India 🇮🇳

## 📌 Project Overview

CodeX is a German beverage company that recently launched its energy drink in 10 Indian cities. The marketing team conducted a large-scale consumer survey (10,000 respondents) to understand customer behavior, brand awareness, preferences, and market opportunities.

This project focuses on transforming raw survey data into **actionable marketing insights** using **pure T-SQL in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** .

---

## 🚀 How to Use This Project

1. **Environment Setup:** Ensure you have SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) installed.
2. **Data Ingestion:** Run `sql/data_ingestion.sql` to import the raw CSV files from the `/data` folder.
3. **Modeling:** Execute `sql/data_modeling.sql` to establish the Star Schema and primary/foreign key relationships.
4. **Validation:** (New!) Run `sql/data_integrity_checks.sql` to ensure data quality.
5. **Optimization:** (New!) Run `sql/performance_optimization.sql` to apply indexes for faster query performance.
6. **Analysis:** Use `sql/analysis_queries.sql` to generate marketing insights.

## 📈 Suggested Business Intelligence Roadmap
To further enhance this project, future iterations could include:
* **Power BI Integration:** Connecting the Star Schema to Power BI for interactive dashboarding.
* **Predictive Modeling:** Using Python (Scikit-Learn) to predict "Health Concern" trends based on respondent demographics.
* **Automated ETL:** Setting up SQL Server Agent jobs to automate the data refresh process.

## 🎯 Objective

The primary objective of this project is to:

- Analyze consumer survey data using SQL
- Design a dimensional data model for analytics
- Answer key business and marketing questions
- Enable data-driven decisions for brand growth, pricing, marketing channels, and product development

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **SQL Server**
- **T-SQL**
- **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**
- Dimensional Modeling (Star Schema)
- Analytical SQL (CTEs, Window Functions, Aggregations)

> ⚠️ No external BI tools are used. All insights are derived directly using T-SQL queries.

## 📂 Dataset Description

The project uses three CSV files:

### 1️⃣ `dim_respondents`

Contains demographic details of survey participants:

- Respondent ID
- Age group
- Gender
- City ID

### 2️⃣ `dim_cities`

Contains city-level information:

- City name
- City tier

### 3️⃣ `fact_survey_responses`

Contains survey responses related to:

- Consumption habits
- Brand awareness & perception
- Competitor preferences
- Pricing, packaging & marketing channels
- Health concerns & product expectations

---

## 🏗️ Data Modeling Approach

A **star schema** is created to support analytical queries:

- **Fact Table**
  - `fact_survey_responses`
- **Dimension Tables**
  - `dim_respondents`
  - `dim_cities`

This structure enables efficient slicing of survey insights by:

- Demographics
- Geography
- Consumption behavior
- Brand perception

---

## 🔄 Project Workflow

1. Data ingestion from CSV into SQL Server
2. Data cleaning and validation using T-SQL
3. Creation of dimension and fact tables
4. Implementation of relationships and keys
5. Business-driven analytical queries
6. Insight generation aligned with marketing goals
